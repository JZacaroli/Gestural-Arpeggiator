# Gestural-Arpeggiator


A homemade instrument, the Gestural Arpeggiator has two accelerometers placed on either end of a poster tube which are connected to an Arduino. This information is fed via Bluetooth to the Wekinator which is able to recognize gestures and ultimately controls the performance of a synthesizer/arpeggiator implemented in Max.
